    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is managed by a database management system (DBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-based: SQL databases are table-based, and the schema (structure) must be defined before data is inserted.\n",
    "Relational: SQL databases are relational databases (RDBMS) that use structured query language for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "ACID Compliance: Ensures reliable transactions with properties of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: NoSQL databases are more flexible and can store unstructured data without a predefined schema.\n",
    "Variety of Data Models: They support various data models such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-oriented, and graph-based.\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: Designed to scale out by adding more servers easily.\n",
    "BASE Compliance: Focuses on Basic Availability, Soft state, and Eventual consistency.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase.\n"
