    "\"\"\"Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans. Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system while only exposing the necessary functionalities or interfaces to the users. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a car. From a user's perspective, they don't need to know the intricate details of how the engine, transmission, or brakes work. They only need to know how to interact with the car, such as pressing the accelerator, brake, or turning the steering wheel. In this case, the internal mechanisms of the car are abstracted away, and users interact with the car's interface, such as pedals and steering wheel.\"\"\""

Abstract base classes are classes that are meant to be subclassed but not instantiated themselves. They define methods that must be implemented by their subclasses.\n",
