    "\n",
    "Ans.In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. The different modes of opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r': Opens the file in read-only mode. The pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "'w': Opens the file in write-only mode. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "'a': Opens the file in append mode. The pointer is placed at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "'r+': Opens the file for both reading and writing. The pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "'w+': Opens the file for both reading and writing. It truncates the file to zero length if it exists, otherwise creates a new file.\n",
    "'a+': Opens the file for both reading and appending. The pointer is placed at the end of the file if it exists, otherwise creates a new file."

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.The close() function is used to close an open file. It is important to close a file after opening and performing operations on it because it releases the resources associated with the file, freeing them up for use by other parts of the program or other programs. Failure to close files can lead to resource leaks and can cause issues with file locking and concurrency."
