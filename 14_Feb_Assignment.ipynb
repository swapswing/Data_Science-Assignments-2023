    "# Q1). What is multithreading in python?Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Multithreading is a programming concept where multiple threads are spawned by a process to execute tasks concurrently. In Python, it allows for the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. This is useful for I/O-bound tasks where the program is waiting for external events (like file I/O, network communication), allowing other parts of the program to continue running without being blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to improve the performance of a program by enabling concurrent execution. It can make a program more efficient by utilizing the time when one thread is waiting for I/O operations or other blocking tasks, allowing other threads to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is the 'threading' module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module is used for creating and managing threads. It provides a high-level interface to work with threads and includes various functions and classes to help manage thread creation, execution, and synchronization.\n",

    "\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, causing them to be stuck in a permanent waiting state. This can happen when multiple threads have circular dependencies on resources.\n",

    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "\n",

    "A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events such as thread execution order. It typically happens when multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable results.\n",
