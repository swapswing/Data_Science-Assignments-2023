    "When you want a feature selection method that is not dependent on a specific machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "When Feature Interactions Are Not Critical:\n",

    "Analyze Features: Review the dataset to understand feature types (e.g., numerical, categorical, or binary) and their relationship with the target variable (churn: yes/no).\n",
    "Identify Redundant or Irrelevant Features: Identify and eliminate features that are constant or have low variance, as they provide minimal information.\n",

    "Use statistical metrics to evaluate the importance of each feature relative to the target variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical Features: Use correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson or Spearman) to measure the strength of the linear or rank relationship with churn.\n",
    "Categorical Features: Use statistical tests like the chi-square test to evaluate dependency between features and the target.\n",
    "Mixed or Complex Relationships: Use mutual information to capture non-linear relationships between features and the target.\n",
    "Step 4: Rank Features\n",
    "Assign scores to each feature based on the chosen metric(s).\n",
    "Rank features in descending order of relevance.\n",
    "Step 5: Select Top Features\n",
    "Set a threshold for the relevance score or select the top-k features with the highest scores.\n",

They combine the strengths of filter and wrapper methods, offering a balance between computational efficiency and model performance. In this context, we'll explore how to apply embedded methods to select the most relevant features for predicting soccer match outcomes.\n",

    "Extract Feature Importance:\n",
    "\n",

    "Lasso/Ridge: Examine the coefficients. Features with coefficients close to zero are less important.\n",
    "Decision Trees/Random Forests: Analyze feature importance scores, which indicate how much each feature contributes to the model's predictions.\n",
    "Select Features:\n",
    "\n",

    "Train a new model using only the selected features.\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).   \n",
    "If necessary, adjust the feature selection threshold or iterate with different models to optimize performance.\n",

After training, you observe that the coefficients for HomeTeamStrikerRating, AwayTeamStrikerRating, and MatchWeather are very close to zero. This suggests that these features have minimal impact on the model's predictions.\n",
